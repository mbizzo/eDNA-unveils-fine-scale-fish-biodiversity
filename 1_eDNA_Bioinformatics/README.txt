#### `1_eDNA_Bioinformatics/`

Contains the complete bioinformatics workflow used to process raw sequencing reads into ZOTU (zero-radius OTU) count tables and assign taxonomic identities.

##### Sequencing Runs

This directory includes results from two sequencing runs:

- `p751_run_250522` – MiFish12S metabarcode  
- `p751_run_220617` – Fish16S metabarcode  

Each run folder contains:

- **`..._Reports/`**  
  - `MapFileTemplate/`: Index sequences and metabarcode primers used per sample  
  - `WorkflowSummaryLog/`: Summary of the bioinformatics steps used to generate ZOTU tables and taxonomic assignments  
  - `Reports/`: Report files generated by the pipeline, including quality and summary statistics  

- **`..._Results/`**  
  - ZOTU count tables and raw taxonomic assignments (prior to geographic filtering)

##### Final Taxonomic Assignments

- **`FinalAssignmentsUsed_12S16S_TH90_Geography.xlsx`**  
  Contains the curated taxonomic assignments used in the study after geographic validation and reassignment.

We evaluated the validity of taxonomic assignments by cross-referencing with known distributions in the tropical Indo-West Pacific marine bioregion (Briggs and Bowen, 2012). Reference databases included:

- Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF, 2001; accessed 24.04.2024)  
- Australian Faunal Directory (ABRS, 2020; accessed 24.04.2024)  
- FishBase (2021; accessed 24.04.2024)

If a taxon was not documented in the region in any of these databases, it was conservatively reassigned to a lower, more plausible taxonomic level known to occur in Shark Bay.
